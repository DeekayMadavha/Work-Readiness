Situation:
I needed to create a professional CV to apply for internship opportunities and academic submissions. I realized that I didn’t have a formal, structured document that showcased my qualifications, skills, and experiences in a clear and appealing way.

Task:
My task was to design and compile a comprehensive CV that accurately reflects my academic background, project experiences, technical skills, and personal achievements — while ensuring it follows standard CV conventions and is tailored to the positions I was targeting.

Action:
I began by researching different CV formats and templates online to understand the essential sections and layout preferences for my industry.

I listed all my relevant experiences, including academic projects, group work, and positions of responsibility.

I organized the CV under appropriate headings: Personal Information, Profile Summary, Education, Skills, Projects, Work Experience, Certifications, and References.

I used bullet points and action-oriented language to describe my experiences and responsibilities.

I proofread the document for grammar and clarity, and requested feedback from a lecturer and a peer.

I adjusted the CV layout to be clean, modern, and easy to read while maintaining professionalism.

Result:
I successfully completed a well-structured, polished CV that highlights my qualifications and achievements. The CV helped me feel more confident when applying for internship roles and submitting applications for academic projects. Additionally, the feedback I received was positive, noting its clarity and professional tone. It also gave me a clear template I can easily update in the future.
